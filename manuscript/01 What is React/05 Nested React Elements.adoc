= What is React

== Nested React Elements

When using React, all your HTML tags should be created by React itself. So, this code doesn't work as properly as you want:

[source,javascript]
----
var reactElement = React.createElement("div", null, "Hello <b>React</b>");
ReactDOM.render(reactElement, document.getElementById('app'));
----

As you see, the output is not the desired want. This is because all HTML tags should be generated by React itself. So for the above example, we should write something like this:

[source,javascript]
----
var myBoldElement = React.createElement("b", null, "World");
var myDivElement = React.createElement("div", null, "Hello ", myBoldElement);

ReactDOM.render(myDivElement, document.getElementById('app'));
----

Cool! The `createElement` method, accept any arguments after the 3rd one, as the content, so you can pass any text or other React elements as the arguments and the React will concat all of them:

[source,javascript]
----
var myBoldElement = React.createElement("b", null, "Real");
var myItalicElement = React.createElement("i", null, "Wonderfull!");
var myDivElement = React.createElement("div", null, "Hello ", myBoldElement, " World. ", myItalicElement);


ReactDOM.render(myDivElement, document.getElementById('app'));
----
